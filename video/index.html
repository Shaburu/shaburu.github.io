        The first impression of a website plays a crucial role in determining the bounce rate
        <br>
        Why settle for Videos that can be made using vanilla HTML and some CSS Animation as a video on your site?
        <br>
        While videos can be visually appealing, it's important to consider their impact on website performance. You don't want to slow down your site with a video if it doesn't contribute to maximizing user engagement, retention, and conversion rates.
        (My videos are significantly small in their file size!)
        <br>
        I create visually stunning and interactive elements that grab the users' attention, encouraging them to explore further and stay on the site longer. This way, every aspect of the website contributes to the 100% value you expect and helps you achieve the best return on your investment.
